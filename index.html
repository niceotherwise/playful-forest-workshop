<h1 class="tc">Playful Interactions with Forests: Humans and Beyond?</h1>
<p>Humankind’s current relationship with nature could be described as being multi-faceted and at times contradictory: while we cherish nature and the rich experiences it affords, we often treat it as a mere resource to exploit, leading to an ever looming threat of ecological collapse. We are growing disconnected from nature, yet increasingly aware that we are both connected and dependent on the ecosystems that sustain us. Interestingly, tech’s role as a human-nature interaction mediator can also be ambivalent: it can enable both utilitarian, colonialist, and damaging ways of relating to nature just as much as it can support caring, joyful, and sustainable human-nature entanglements. Careful consideration of the values behind nature tech innovation seems crucial when it comes to facilitating holistically sustainable developments.<p></p>

<p>We would like to invite you to a one-day workshop at CHI 2023, on April 23th, to consider these issues. In order to take part, we ask you to kindly prepare a position presentation, paper or materials. This position paper does not have to take on the form of a traditional paper, but we encourage any representation that makes sense for you, as long as it can be experienced by others. We ask you to include three major sections in your position paper:</p> 

<ul>
    <li><span class="b">Firstly, an overview of your motivation to take part.</span> The following questions may be used as guidance for what to include in this section: 1) Who are you, and what do you do? 2) What do you bring into the workshop space, or would like to bring into the workshop space? 3) Would you like to prepare and run a small design activity during the workshop? 4) Are there any materials (design frameworks…) you would like to bring, for others to try out?</li>
    <li><span class="b">Secondly, a forestscape.</span> We conceptualize a forestscape as a representation of your personal experience of encountering a forest, which may include photos, audio, personal reflections and writing, textures etc. We recognise that not everyone may be able to go physically to a forest, so we also encourage forestscapes that are based on digital representations of forests, e.g. videos or photos. </li>
    <li><span class="b">Thirdly, a short biography of yourself (3-4 sentences).</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="b bg-yellow pa3 br3">Please send your position materials to <a href="mailto:velvet.spors@tuni.fi" class="link dim dark-green">velvet.spors@tuni.fi</a>, with the final deadline being the 12th January 2023.</p>
    
<p>Please ensure that your position material uses a commonly used file format and encoding, e.g. PDF, JPEG, MPEG or MP3, or hosting, e.g. DropBox, unlinked YouTube video, to ensure that we can access it.</p>

<p>Out of fairness to others, please keep the contents of your position materials brief, e.g. if it was laid out as a traditional paper, it would be not longer than 3 pages, or around 2500 words. Workshop organizers will review all submissions, and admittance to the workshop will be based on relevance to it. If accepted, we require at least one author to attend the workshop, either in person or online, who must also register for at least one day of the conference.</p> 

<p>This workshop is open to all! We explicitly encourage submissions from everybody: No prior experience or expertise is needed, only an interest in HNI and forests, and a curiosity about play, imaginative practises and/or games.</p>

    <li><span class="b">Oğuz ‘Oz’ Buruk</span> (he/him) is an assistant professor of gameful experience in the Gamification Group at Tampere University, Tampere, Finland. He holds a PhD in Interaction Design (2017) from Koç University-Arçelik Research Center for Creative Industries (KUAR). His work focuses on designing playful devices and environments and research interests are playful wearables, posthumanism, smart cities, human-nature interaction and fictional methods in design. <a href="www.oguzturanburuk.com" class="dark-green dim link">www.oguzturanburuk.com</a></li>
    <li><span class="b">>Ferran Altarriba Bertran</span> (he/him) is an interaction designer and researcher, currently serving as a post-doctoral researcher in the Gamification Group (Tampere University) and as a lecturer at Escola Universitària ERAM (Universitat de Girona). His research investigates how to design playful technologies and experiences that enrich the socio-emotional texture of people’s day-to-day. Ferran has co-organized a range of co-design workshops, both in-person and online, both in academic conferences (DIS, CHI, CHI Play, EFOOD...) and beyond. <a href="www.ferranaltarriba.com" class="dark-green dim link">www.ferranaltarriba.com</a></li>
    <li><span class="b">Annika Wolff</span> is an associate professor specialized in co-design and human-data interaction, at the intersection between complex data, machine and human learning. Her research focuses on how people make sense of, interact with and design from complex data and the role of data in building empathy towards more-than human concerns.</li>
    <li><span class="b">Marie Louise Juul Søndergaard</span> (she/her) is a postdoctoral researcher at The Oslo School of Architecture and Design, Norway. Her research explores critical, speculative and feminist approaches to design digital technologies for human and environmental health. Marie Louise has co-organized workshops at CHI and DIS on topics of feminist voices on ecological issues in HCI, women’s health, sexuality, futures, and more-than-human design. <a href="" class="dark-green dim link">www.mljuul.com</a></li>
    <li><span class="b">Eshtiak Ahmed</span> (he/him) is a doctoral researcher at the Gamification Group at Tampere University, Finland. He has a master’s degree in Human-technology interaction (HTI). His current research focuses on leveraging the benefits of human-robot interaction (HRI) to enhance and elevate people’s experience while interacting with nature and forests.</li>
    <li><span class="b">Joon Sang Baek</span> is an associate professor and the director of DESIS Lab at Yonsei University in South Korea. His research areas include design for sustainability, service design, and nature-inspired design. He is currently interested in a systems design approach to complex social problems, a socio-technical approach to the design for relational services and biomimicry for social innovation. <a href="http://desis.yonsei.ac.kr" class="dark-green dim link">http://desis.yonsei.ac.kr</a></li>
    <li class="mb6"><span class="b">Rob Comber</span> (he/him) is an Associate Professor at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in the forest-full Stockholm, Sweden. His work engages with questions of critical feminist perspectives on place and sustainability, and the socio-material entanglements in the production of our everyday lives. He has organised workshops at CHI, DIS, UbiComp, and others, and is the subcommittee chair and co-founder of the CHI subcommittee on Critical and Sustainable Computing.</li>
