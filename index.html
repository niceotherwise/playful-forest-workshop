    <h1>Playful Interactions with Forests: Humans and Beyond?</h1>
<p>Humankind’s current relationship with nature could be described as being multi-faceted and at times contradictory: while we cherish nature and the rich experiences it affords, we often treat it as a mere resource to exploit, leading to an ever looming threat of ecological collapse. We are growing disconnected from nature, yet increasingly aware that we are both connected and dependent on the ecosystems that sustain us. Interestingly, tech’s role as a human-nature interaction mediator can also be ambivalent: it can enable both utilitarian, colonialist, and damaging ways of relating to nature just as much as it can support caring, joyful, and sustainable human-nature entanglements. Careful consideration of the values behind nature tech innovation seems crucial when it comes to facilitating holistically sustainable developments.<p></p>

<p>We would like to invite you to a one-day workshop at CHI 2023, on April 23th, to consider these issues.In order to take part, we ask you to kindly prepare a position presentation, paper or materials. This position paper does not have to take on the form of a traditional paper, but we encourage any representation that makes sense for you, as long as it can be experienced by others. We ask you to include three major sections in your position paper:</p> 

<ul>
    <li>Firstly, an overview of your motivation to take part. The following questions may be used as guidance for what to include in this section: 1) Who are you, and what do you do? 2) What do you bring into the workshop space, or would like to bring into the workshop space? 3) Would you like to prepare and run a small design activity during the workshop? 4) Are there any materials (design frameworks…) you would like to bring, for others to try out?</li>
    <li> Secondly, a forestscape. We conceptualize a forestscape as a representation of your personal experience of encountering a forest, which may include photos, audio, personal reflections and writing, textures etc. We recognise that not everyone may be able to go physically to a forest, so we also encourage forestscapes that are based on digital representations of forests, e.g. videos or photos. </li>
    <li>Thirdly, a short biography of yourself (3-4 sentences).  </li>
</ul>
<p>Please send your position material to velvet.spors@tuni.fi, with the final deadline being the 12th January 2023.</p>
    
<p>Please ensure that your position material uses a commonly used file format and encoding, e.g. PDF, JPEG, MPEG or MP3, or hosting, e.g. DropBox, unlinked YouTube video, to ensure that we can access it.</p>

<p>Out of fairness to others, please keep the contents of your position materials brief, e.g. if it was laid out as a traditional paper, it would be not longer than 3 pages, or around 2500 words. Workshop organizers will review all submissions, and admittance to the workshop will be based on relevance to it. If accepted, we require at least one author to attend the workshop, either in person or online, who must also register for at least one day of the conference.</p> 

<p>This workshop is open to all! We explicitly encourage submissions from everybody: No prior experience or expertise is needed, only an interest in HNI and forests, and a curiosity about play, imaginative practises and/or games.</p>
